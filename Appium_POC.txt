Core Framework

     •	The core framework consists of the Page object Model. For each of the App page,
        I have created separate page class. The page specific functionalities are implemented as
        reusable methods inside the page class.
     •	I have also created a class called “BasePage” which contains some of the utility methods 
        like WebDriver Wait, Send Keys,Tap etc.
Page Class package: com.game.pages

     •	BasePage
     •	WelcomePage
     •	SigninPage
     •	LeaguePage
     •	NBABasketBallPage
     •	LeaderPage
     •	PlayerPage
     •	AndroidCapabilities
TestNG

      •	I have used the TestNG Framework to create & execute the Automation Test case. 
        Appropriate Annotations are being within the Test case.

       > Test case is located in folder:src/test/java. The name of the test case is RandomPlayer_TC001. 
How to execute the Test case

      •	 Open the RandomPlayer_TC001 Test case file from the src/test/java .Right Click and
         choose the option TestNG Test to execute the Test case
      

 Note: The Score.Apk file is located inthe folder:  src/main/resources
 
Logging

       •  For the Logging and Debugging purpose, I have implemented the Log4J Framework.
          All the log information from the test case execution will be captured using the Log4J.

       •  The log4j2.xml is located in the properties folder. Place the log4j2.xml file into the classpath. Only then all the log statements will get logged to console.
